## Comet.ml - machine learning experiment management
**Our Misson:** Comet is doing for ML what GitHub did for code. We allow data science teams to automagically track their datasets, code changes, experimentation history and production models creating efficiency, transparency, and reproducibility. 

We all strive to be data driven and yet every day valuable experiments results are just lost and forgotten. Comet.ml provides a dead simple way of fixing that. Works with any workflow, any ML task, any machine and any piece of code.
